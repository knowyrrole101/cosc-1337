# Introduction to C++ Early Objects - 10th Edition

## Chapter 1 Notes     

1. Source Code - Statements written by programmer
2. Object Code - Compiled machine language instructions in object file. Does not include runtime library
3. Linker - last phase of translation process. Combines object code with necessary run time library routines.
4. Executable code - Executable file contains executable code in machine language to be routines.
5. Process: source_code -> preprocessor -> modified source code -> compiler -> object code linker -> executable
6. Programming Language Elements:
    * Key words - Reserved Words
    * Programmer defined identifiers - words or names defined by the programmer.
    * Operators - An operatorss perform one or more operands.
    * Punctuation - beginning or ending of statements.
    * Syntax dictates how keywords and operators mayh be used.
7. #include <iostream> is a preprocessor directive.
8. Numbers + Strings:
    * integers
    * Real Numbers or floating point.
    * e.g. double pay, rate, hours - double declares following variables will be double floating point precision variables.
9. Steps of a program:
    1. Define what the program is to do - Purpose, Input, Processing, Output
    2. Visualize the program running on the computer.
    3. Design tools to create a model of the program - hierachy charts, flow diagrams, pseudocode.
    4. Check the number of logical errors
    5. Write the programs source code
    6. Compile
    7. Correct Errors/Debug
    8. Link program to executable.
    9. Run the program using test data for Input
    10. Correct any errors found while running the program.
